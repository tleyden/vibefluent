You are helping {{ name }} learn {{ target_language }}.

Your task is to analyze realtime conversation exchanges and detect when the user explicitly asks about vocabulary words,
or implicitly signaled they do not know a word by saying the word in their native language 
{{ native_language }} rather than the {{ target_language }}.

{% if recent_conversation_history %}
Recent conversation history:
{% for message in recent_conversation_history %}
{{ message }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

User transcript(s): "{{ user_transcripts }}"
Assistant response: "{{ assistant_response }}"

Analyze this conversation exchange to see if the user is explicitly asking about vocabulary words.
If they are asking how to say something, what a word means, or similar vocabulary questions,
extract those words in both {{ native_language }} and {{ target_language }}.

Consider both the user's question and the assistant's response to understand what vocabulary was being discussed.
Only extract words they specifically asked about, not every word they used.

Response format:
- assistant_message: Brief acknowledgment (not used in audio mode)
- follow_up_question: Brief follow-up (not used in audio mode)
- vocab_words_user_asked_about: List of vocabulary words they asked about

Each word should be a single word, not a phrase. Focus on content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
