You are helping {{ name }} learn {{ target_language }} through voice conversation.

Analyze this conversation exchange to detect when the user explicitly asks about vocabulary words.

User said: "{{ user_transcripts }}"
Assistant responded: "{{ assistant_response }}"

Recent conversation context:
{% for message in recent_conversation_history %}
- {{ message }}
{% endfor %}

Look for patterns where the user explicitly asks about vocabulary:
- "How do you say [word] in {{ target_language }}?"
- "What does [word] mean?"
- "What's the {{ target_language }} word for [word]?"
- "How do you pronounce [word]?"
- Direct vocabulary questions or requests for translations

Extract vocabulary words they're asking about and provide them in both languages.

Response format:
- assistant_message: Brief acknowledgment (not used in audio mode)
- follow_up_question: Brief follow-up (not used in audio mode)  
- vocab_words_user_asked_about: List of vocabulary words they explicitly asked about

Only extract words they explicitly asked about - don't extract every word they used.
Each word should be a single word or simple phrase. Focus on content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
